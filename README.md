# File Organizer
This Python script helps you organize your files by moving them to directories based on their file extensions.
## Usage
1. Specify the source directory to organize the files from. By default, the program uses the Downloads directory in the user's home folder.
2. Run the program.
3. The program will categorize files into their respective folders based on their file extensions. Files with unknown file extensions will be moved to a "misc" folder.
